<h1>Jangle: Snmp Browser</h1>

<p>The Jangle Snmp browser is a graphical utility to browse through and
display the various statistics exported via snmp.</p>

<p>At the top of the window you can enter a hostname or IP address of
the device you wish to query, the community string to be used, and
alter the port number the server is listening on.</p>

<h2>The left panel</h2>

<p>The left panel contains two tabs which show a either a list or a
tree view of the available OIDs.</p>

<h2>The right panel</h2>

<p>The right panel contains tabs displaying the available data.</p>

<ul>

<li>Details - shows the value of the currently selected OID, and a
chart if it's a numeric type.</li>

<li>About - shows information about the currently selected OID if it
can be obtained from installed MIB files.</li>

<li>Siblings - shows details of siblings of the current OID (different
instances with the same parent, usually representing multiple instances
of the same attribute), and a chart if they are of a numeric
type.</li>

<li>Cousins - shows details of cousins of the current OID (same instance
with a common grandparent, usually representing the available
attributes of a given object), and a chart of those that are a numeric
type.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The toolbar</h2>

<p>The toolbar contains a small number of menus.</p>

<ul>

<li>File - allows you to exit the Jangle Snmp Browser, create a new
browser, and load MIB files from a non-standard location.</li>

<li>Update every - allows you to change how rapidly the statistics are
updated. Note that some snmp servers will only update their data every
30 seconds, leading to anomalous behaviour if you update more
frequently.</li>

<li>Help - shows this help file, and the CDDL license that this
software is licensed under.</li>

</ul>
