Bugs/Features:

Support other snmp versions

Derive whether it's a value or a rate

Sets and filters.

Simple graph: given a host and an OID, graph it.

Multiple server support - graph same thing from different hosts

Need ability to keep graphing one thing and go look at something
else. Maybe some sort of dock where the graphs you're viewing get
stored.

Better mib parser

If the MIB specifies a range, use that to set the y-range of the chart
